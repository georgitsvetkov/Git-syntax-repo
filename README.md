# GiT-test-repo - basic formating

## Sample repo with markdown formats (gh repo)


# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents which you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.


### Quoting text

You can quote text with a ">".

Text that is not a quote
> Text that is a quote


### Quoting code

You can quote code, using single quote "'".

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

### Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut Command+K to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).


### Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

-  Washington
-  Adams
-  Jefferson
Rendered unordered list

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

1.  Madison
2.  Monroe
3.  Quincy Adams


### Nested lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
    - Second nested list item


### Task lists

To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:

If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:

- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue


### Hiding content with comments

You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.

<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->


### Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.


### Images

You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
